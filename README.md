## üß† How It Works

1. Selenium logs into the chess stream URL
2. Screenshots are taken on every board update
3. Image is converted to base64 and sent to Azure OpenAI Vision
4. Commentary is generated using system and user prompts
5. Commentary is converted to speech using Azure Speech
6. Audio is queued and played back using `simpleaudio`

## üí° Future Enhancements

* Add support for FEN/PGN parsing for higher accuracy
* Support multiple voice options and languages
* Stream to Twitch or YouTube with live commentary overlay
* Build a GUI for easy configuration and game monitoring
